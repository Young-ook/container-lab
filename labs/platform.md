# Overview
Platform engineering builds and maintains internal developer platforms (IDPs) with self-service tools, automated workflows, and standardized environments to boost developer productivity, reduce complexity, and speed up software delivery by abstracting infrastructure details and allowing developers to focus on code. It's considered a modern evolution of DevOps, treating the platform itself as a product with developers as customers, ensuring secure, compliant, and efficient application lifecycles.

## kind
kind (Kubernetes IN Docker) is a tool for running local Kubernetes clusters using Docker container 'nodes'. Please follow the instructions in [kind.md](kind/kind.md) to enable your local Kubernetes cluster if you don't have testing environment for other labs.

## Devtron
